<h2>THE EPIC OF PAUL.</h2>

<p>The action of <span class="smcap">The Epic of Paul</span> begins with that conspiracy
formed at Jerusalem against the life of the apostle
which in the sequel led to a prolonged suspension of his
free missionary career. It embraces the incidents of his
removal from Jerusalem to Cæsarea, of his imprisonment at
the latter place, of his journey to Rome for trial before
Cæsar, and of his final martyrdom.</p>

<p>The design of the poem as a whole is to present, through
conduct on Paul's part and through speech from him, a living
portrait of the man that he was, together with a reflex of his
most central and most characteristic teaching.</p>

<h2>BOOK I.</h2>

<h3>PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT.</h3>


<p>Paul is arraigned before the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem.
He had the day preceding been murderously set upon by a
Jewish mob, from whose hands he was with difficulty rescued
by a Roman officer, to be held as a prisoner supposed of
infamous character. While Paul is thus held, a conspiracy
of desperate Jews is formed by Shimei against his life. This
conspiracy is fortunately discovered and exposed by Stephen,
a young nephew of the apostle, acting at the instance of his
mother Rachel, Paul's sister, and under the advice of Gamaliel,
Paul's old teacher.</p>

<span class="i2">The old man bent upon the boy his brow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"The world grows gray in wickedness, my son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the Lord God of all intends, who knows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most wise is He, but deep, in many ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past human finding out. Thine uncle Saul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is hated for himself by Shimei<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more than for his cause. And Shimei<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With inward adjuration then, a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uplifted as in gesture to repel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamaliel deeply added, "O my soul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stephen, well-schooled in awe of the hoar head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood an uneasy instant silent, then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yielded to his untamable desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of action and impatience of delay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Rabban," he importunately cried,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Yea, verily, Stephen; also that might chance,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamaliel answered with benignity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He almost let grave admiration breathe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through softly-lighted look and gentle tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of benediction on the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he, unhastened, felt the youthful haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made the stripling Stephen beautiful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For David was a shepherd lad, when he<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thine uncle, lad, was ever from a youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headstrong to think his thought and will his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man might bend him from his own fixed bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any man, then I; he honored me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Thy saving power I pray thee now put forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck mine uncle from the jaws of death.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Yea, I remember," now Gamaliel spoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Weep not, my boy, but haste, my bidding do."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith Gamaliel clapped his aged hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When instantly a servant to his call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood on the roof with, "Master, here am I."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"An inkhorn and a pen, with parchment; speed!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from Gamaliel's lips, so short, so sharp<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With instance, that the man not went, but flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Make thou a table of my knees, and write,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gamaliel to forestalling Stephen said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Write: 'I, Gamaliel, send this lad to thee;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy hearing; thou canst trust him all in all.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, so is well; now superscribe it fair:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Saul will to the chief captain get thee brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hereby shalt win believing heed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No thanks, and no farewell, but thy feet wing!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So sped, but of his own heart better sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen quick got him to the castle gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, with Gamaliel's seal displayed&mdash;his truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patent in face and voice, admitting him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gained prompt privilege of speech with Paul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paul heard the tidings that his nephew brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, summoning a centurion, said to him:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

<span class="i2">So the centurion, taking Stephen, went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the chief captain, and thus spoke to him:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Roman, on the boy ennobled so<br /></span>

<span class="i2">However wrought on, Claudius Lysias,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And said: "And now, my pretty Hebrew lad,<br /></span>

<p>The aged Gamaliel has his wish and enjoys a prolonged
interview with the prisoner Paul in the castle where the latter
is confined&mdash;young Stephen being present. The result is
Gamaliel's conversion to Christianity; but this is followed by
the old man's peaceful death on the couch where he had been
resting while he talked. So peaceful is the death that, in
the darkness of the late evening, Paul and young Stephen
are not aware that it has occurred.</p>

<span class="i0">That knowledge is the one true treasure mine;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I have had sorrow, but amid it joy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rest, deeper than the weariness, has still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My much-abounding weariness beguiled;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A fountain of sweet water still I find<br /></span>

<h3>SHIMEI AND THE CHILIARCH.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<p>Paul, accompanied by young Stephen, is started at about
midnight, under strong military escort, for Cæsarea. At the
gate of the castle, Shimei, lurking there, is arrested, and
brought before the chiliarch, Claudius Lysias by name. A
conversation ensues, in which Shimei, for a time with some
success, practises on the chiliarch his characteristic arts of
deception. At last, the chiliarch, denouncing him for what
he is, and putting him under heavy bonds to respond in person,
whenever and wherever afterward commanded by the
Roman authorities, dismisses him from presence, chagrined
and dismayed.</p>

<p>The narrative returns to Paul riding with young Stephen,
under escort of Roman soldiers, toward Cæsarea. The uncle
and nephew (at sufficient remove from the cavalry before
them and the infantry behind them) after an interval of
silence, engage in conversation on a subject suggested by
young Stephen's quoting against Shimei one of the imprecatory
psalms. This conversation is prolonged till Antipatris
is reached, from which point young Stephen comes back to
Jerusalem with the returning foot-soldiers, while Paul goes
on with the horse to Cæsarea.</p>

<p>Stephen, having returned, goes at once to the chiliarch,
his secret purpose being to convict Shimei of his crime,
through certain evidence which he thinks he can bring to
bear on the case. To the youth's disappointment and
chagrin, he is received coldly and repellently by the chiliarch
now much out of humor as a sequel to his disagreeable interview
with Shimei. Dismissed crestfallen to go, Stephen
is suddenly confronted at the door by Shimei, at that
moment arriving in obedience to a summons from the chiliarch.
The mutual encounter has the effect on the chiliarch
observing it, to change his attitude toward Stephen, making
it favorable again. Shimei is sent to Cæsarea under suspicion;
where Felix, the governor, plans a hearing for the
prisoner Paul.</p>

<h3>PAUL BEFORE FELIX.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>


<p>Paul discourses solemnly before Felix and his queen
Drusilla, treating the topics of righteousness, self-control,
and impending judgment. The effect is to make Felix show
visible signs of discomposure on his judgment-seat. Drusilla,
apprehensive of consequences disastrous to herself from her
wicked husband's awakened remorse and fear, invokes the
intervention of Simon, that Cyprian Jewish sorcerer who had
at first been instrumental in bringing the guilty pair together.
Simon plays upon the superstition of Felix with his pretended
magic arts.</p>

<p>Paul, in preferred alternative to being judged, as was
proposed, by his murderous fellow-countrymen, appeals to
Cæsar. He is in consequence embarked on a ship for
Rome. With him sail certain kindred and friends of his,
young Stephen among them. Fellow-voyagers with him are
also Felix and Drusilla, fallen now from power and under
cloud at Rome. Shimei and Simon the sorcerer are of the
company. The voyage is described, together with some of
the notable prospects of the coasts along which the vessel
sails. Shimei plots against the life of Paul. His plot is
thwarted by young Stephen, and the culprit is thrown into
dungeon in the hold under chains.</p>

<span class="i0">The youth had lapped him in a happy muse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Prolonging softer the full light of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei thought darkly: 'Could yon leaning form<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who might be spared, forsooth, accusing whom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own forestalling conscience had condemned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So it should look!) and forced him on to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Vengeance is mine and recompense," as saith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Moses, hinting of a moment when<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From underneath'&mdash;and Shimei acted out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pantomimic gesture his quick thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'An accidental movement, were it seen,<br /></span>

<h3>SHIMEI BEFORE JULIUS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>


<p>The centurion Julius, having in charge the prisoners on
board including Paul, examines Shimei, accused of his crime
by the sentinel whom the crafty Hebrew had sought to bribe.
Shimei makes a desperate effort to clear himself by bringing
a countercharge against Paul of the same murderous attempt
through bribe upon his, Shimei's, life. Almost on the point
of succeeding, he is confronted first with Felix, then with
Stephen, last with Paul&mdash;to his complete undoing.</p>

<span class="i0">What if his captain, prompted by such hint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should now demand to see that dastard gold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been silent touching it because<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The soldier listened like a criminal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against him, and, besides, my life destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soldier yielded: grievous wrong indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet him I can forgive, for less as bribed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Paul is the master of an evil art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make his subject firmly hold for true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, free from sorcery, he would know was false.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, in the very act and article<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Aided him here; I hardly knew, myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing him speak, but that the voice was mine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So much to him himself, he being deceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This worthy soldier, whom I never wronged,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Should Julius, as looked likely more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length accept the Hebrew's tale for true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In letting it appear that Paul in fact<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To cheat him into honest misbelief.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Provided for the soldier his escape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the necessity of holding fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In self-defence, to his first testimony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, if all prospered, Shimei, yea, might yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save to himself the future chance to use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This soldier, more amenable to use.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Paul's keeper, thus prepared to falter, heard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"What sayest thou, soldier? Wast beside thyself?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dazed, hast thou then denounced the innocent man?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto ambiguous answer thus he framed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If I have done so, it was in excess<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Thou art not sure? A witness should be sure;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shimei shrank visibly, while Felix, glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vent his hatred of the pander, spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As many as his words, so many lies;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wherewith the haughty freedman on his heel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned, as disdaining to use tongue or ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further in such a cause, and disappeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Julius in silence looked a questioning pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Shimei, who risked parrying answer, thus:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wisest it looked to him not to invoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A witness of so much uncertain power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring his own behavior into doubt.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This way or that, as best would serve himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promised so fair to make his side prevail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Confession of dismay in countenance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Julius checked the challenge on his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, turning, said to Shimei: "Need we more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or art unmasked to thy contentment, Jew?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I bid hither Paul, forsooth, and let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee face the uncle, since the nephew so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simply to see, thy gullet fills with gall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twists thy wizened features all awry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, for meseems it were a happy thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, lad, and call thy kinsman hither straight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay, hast thou seen him since last night's farewell?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay," answered Stephen. "Well!" the Roman said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"So tell him nothing now of what is here.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Say only, 'The centurion wishes thee';<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, bring him." Stephen soon returned with Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wondered, knowing naught of all, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the encounter was, for him prepared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Not till now ever, since the fateful time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, buoyant with the sense of his reprieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won for a season from the contact loathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Shimei, Paul rode forth Damascus-ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had they two in such mutual imminence met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paul looked at Shimei now, not with regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, like a bayonet fixed, thrust him aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or icily transpierced him pitiless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a gentle pathos of surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sorrow yearning to be sympathy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reciprocal forgiveness interchanged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between them, and all difference reconciled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A melting heaven of cloudless April blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to weep suffusion of warm tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aspect seemed of Paul on Shimei turned.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Responsive find, or, failing that, create!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But Shimei did not take the look benign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paul, to feel its vernal power; downcast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes he dropped and missed the virtue shed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missed, yet not so as not some gracious force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungraciously, ill knowing, to admit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Thou knowest this fellow-countryman of thine?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the apostle speaking, Julius said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I know him, yea," said Paul. "And knowest perhaps,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Julius, further sounding, "what the chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mischief from him thou hast late escaped?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, but not yet have I, I trow," Paul said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Escaped the evil he fain would bring on me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hates me, and, if but he could, he would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite rid me from the world; that know I well."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But knowest thou," the centurion pressed, "how he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plotted last night to have thee overboard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wrestle, swimming, with the swirling sea?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay," Paul said, "nay; I knew not that." He spoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without surprise couched in his tone; far less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horror or fear expressed in look or act;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sidelong stab at Shimei from his eye;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Only some sadness, with the patience, dashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weariness with which he spoke. "And yet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet," he added, half as if he would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extenuate what he could, "it is his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The natural way in which he works his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will I well can understand, though not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so, his way. From that I was averse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever, but once I had myself his will."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou canst not mean his will to get Paul slain,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baffled, the Roman said. "Nay, but his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To persecute and utterly to destroy,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Paul, "the Name, and all that own the Name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my Lord Jesus Christ from off the earth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At that Name, thus with loyal love confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoarded hatred, deep in Shimei's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward Jesus, which so long had fed and fired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The embers of the hatred his for Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred angrily; it almost overcame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cringing craven personal fear in him.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For thy destruction, of his crime accused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, how, thinkest thou, he would purge himself?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, by persuading me that Paul, instead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then all the man with saving terror shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear Paul speak&mdash;in tones wherein no ire,<br /></span>

<p>In sequel of the tragic crime and doom that had just been
witnessed by him in the case of Shimei, young Stephen is
drawn to resume with his kinsman Paul the topic of the
imprecatory psalms, which they had previously discussed on
their night ride from Jerusalem toward Cæsarea. Paul gently
lets his nephew unbosom all his heart, and, point by point,
meets the young man's difficulties with senior counsel and
instruction.</p>

<span class="i2">The brilliant weather, with the sparkling sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue under the blue heaven above it bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the great sun, his solitary state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making his own pomp as it moved along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that imperial progress through the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blithe wind blowing in the singing sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gay answer of the bounding bark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either hand bright glimpses of the shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these things to enliven were not enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that day's need to Paul and those with him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They could not rally to their customed cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serious, not sad, although light-hearted never.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deed of Shimei and scarce less his doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still damped their spirits, so strung to sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sunny day wore on to starry night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then, Paul and Stephen by themselves apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resting, the younger to the elder said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Much, O mine uncle, have I pondered, since,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep things that I heard from thee, that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already now so many months ago,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By thy side riding, thou by Lysias sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Safeguarded by his Romans from the Jews!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear out thy duress at Cæsarea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert then as now escaped from Shimei's snare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spake, thou wilt remember, of those psalms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which breathe, or seem to breathe, such breath of hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had recited one aloud to thee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To myself rather, bold, for thee to hear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vent to the feeling fierce that in my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boiled into tempest against Shimei.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou chidedst me with a most sweet rebuke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drew the tumor all, out of my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou taughtst me then that the good Spirit of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who breathed the inspiration into men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To utter such dire words, seeming of hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hated not any as I to hate had dared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I understood thee that God only so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealed in forms of vivid human speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The implacable resentment&mdash;but I pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pause startled at the word I use; I would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could I, find other than such words as these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Resentment,' 'indignation,' 'hatred,' 'wrath,'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To speak my thought of holy God aflame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With infinite displacency at sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more! Another word I fain would shun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by some tether that I cannot break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound, I revolve in the same circle still."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As if his speech were half soliloquy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth let lapse his musing into mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which not with word or sign would Paul invade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost with admiration, with such joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hope for Stephen, Paul remarked in him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble gains of knowledge he had made&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom say rather out of knowledge won&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those two years at Cæsarea spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years for the youth so rich in fruitful chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of converse with his elders, and of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in that quick young mind, for brooding apt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less than apt for action, brought to full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet ripeness all that he from other learned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touched it with a quality his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paul could not but in measure feel himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given back to him reflected in the words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he just now had heard from Stephen's lips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he therein felt too a surge of youth<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And youth's unrest and eagerness and strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dauntless heart to assay the impossible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which were all Stephen's. And he held his peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Presently Stephen took up voice again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Almost I thus resolve myself one doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One question, that I thought to bring to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God is not altogether such, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we are; yet are we too somewhat such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As He, for in God's image were we made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we perforce must know God, if at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then by ourselves as patterned after Him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I suppose our best similitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what God feels&mdash;but 'feeling,' also that!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fast do these anthropomorphic walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enclose us still in all our thought of God!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Feeling' is but a parable flung forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By us, bridge-builders on the hither side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tremble out a little way toward God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flutter helpless down in the abyss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The impassable abyss, of difference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between created and Creator, us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Him, the finite and the Infinite!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgive me, but I lose my way in words!"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And again Stephen broke his utterance off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faltering; like one who fording a full stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in midcurrent finds his foothold fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot in such deepened waters walk.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">This time Paul reached the struggling youth a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With: "Thou hast not ill achieved in thine essay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To utter what is nigh unutterable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Stephen, better bridge than any form<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To human sense or reason possible<br /></span>

<p>Arrived at Myra on their way toward Rome, Paul and his
companions are transferred to a different vessel to pursue
their voyage. The new vessel is from Alexandria: it brings
thence as passengers for Rome two mutual friends, one of
them a Roman, the other a Buddhist from India named
Krishna. Rachel, having seen Paul and the Roman greet
each other as old acquaintances, soon inquires apart of Paul
who the Roman is, and, learning is thence drawn on into
exchange of reminiscence and reflection with her brother.
The two at length unite in interceding with Julius on behalf
of Shimei. They secure for him the freedom of the deck.</p>

<h2>BOOK XI.</h2>

<h3>THE LAST OF SHIMEI.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>


<p>Shimei in his feebleness and distress is ministered to by
the companions of Paul. Thus relieved, he falls asleep and
dreams. On his waking, ministration to his needs is renewed;
and, strengthened now with nourishment, he sleeps out the
night. The next morning he finds himself an altered man.
He at length makes some loth acknowledgment to Paul, who
in turn expresses his own sorrow for high words spoken in
pride against Shimei. A storm some days after rises, and
Shimei meets a sudden and awful doom.</p>

<span class="i0">A sudden couch whereon a man might rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen, from out the store of frugal cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his forecasting mother's care purveyed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provision for the needs that might attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chances of sea-faring&mdash;brought and broached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A flagon of sweet wine. This, to the lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Shimei in a slender goblet pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheered him his heart and made him seem to live.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unjointed all his members in remiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Solution of the consciousness of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long deep sleep; a dreamless sleep at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the hours wore on and still he slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious reminiscences in dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Unconscious hoarded treasure of the brain,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were loosed within him of a dewy dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten, and a time when he was young.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He had found the fountain in that land of dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drunk his fill from it with sweet delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famed for its virtue to renew in youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man was a boy again, at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Hebrew home though on an alien shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some soft insinuation crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his sleep from that last waking sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his, the sense, to him unwonted long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lonely man, of wife, of child, bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never sister's gentleness had known&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of touch from woman's hand; however it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei a vision of his mother had.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son, her only, by his mother's knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mother's blossoming hope, her joy, her pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt the benediction of a hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand, laid like a softness on his brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Shimei's lips, no longer thin and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But warm now, and with flush of lifeblood full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved in responsive welcome of a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her kiss, and holy, like a touch of chrism.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fair the vision was that then he saw!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet the tones were that once more he heard!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Such sound, such sight, were better than sweet sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fond sleeper fain would wake, to dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So good a dream awake, and to the full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taste it, with senses and with soul nowise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound from the right fruition of their feast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So, as of his own motion, Shimei woke&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instantly was sorry for the change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes he dared not open to the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding them shut to hold himself asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, in vain! Too late! Full well he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now what he was, and where, and that in truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His happy boyhood had come back in dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lay he lapped in luxury of pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pathos, and sweet pity of himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longings toward a past beyond recall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With something also of a good remorse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was such as then he felt he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor broken worldling, empty heart, and old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In contrast of his visionary youth!),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith perhaps some upward-groping wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he were other. All-undoing stress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was, of elemental motions blind<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<span class="i0">About the bases of his being bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Samson, and his state was overthrown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those agéd eyes that had been used to glint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Metallic lusters, or of adamant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softened beneath the lids, unseen, and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced themselves forth down either temple falling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instinctively he stirred, and with his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Vainly, encumbered with their manacles!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought to brush those trickling tears away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wandered down to mingle with his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long locks, and thin, of iron grey, unkempt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close clinging to the sunken temple walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rachel with Ruth remarked the motions vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently, without word, moved to his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Rachel with her kerchief wiped the tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strokes as of caress, so loving light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Ruth, observing for a moment, turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With token to Eunicé, quick of heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To understand, who hastening lightly thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A laver full of water brought, wherefrom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother washed the forehead and the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As had that agéd man her father been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dried them with a towel clean and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not once the while would Shimei lift the lids<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That trembled shutting over his dim eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange new emotion made him shrink from seeing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shame, and a tenderness of gratitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love, that, with wing-footed Memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran backward to his boyhood and there fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears and kisses on his mother's neck&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered, she, a <em>woman</em>&mdash;such as these!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The squalid wretchedness of his estate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten, and its utter hopelessness,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ministered to as if he were beloved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some one, he who long had no one loved!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted like wax within him was his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when at length they spoke to him, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy hands too, if we might too wash thy hands!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, he neither yes nor no with word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sign replying, they, with yes assumed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did it, assuaging with all healing heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hurts and bruises of the chafing chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the old man with a convulsive wrench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned his whole frame averse from them to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears that streamed in rivers from his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And this they do for love of their Lord Christ!"&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Such muffled words, sobbed out amid his tears<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Lo, Jesus, wilt thou master also me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot bear the pressure of this love!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So Shimei to himself, in words more clear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How prevalent, who knows?&mdash;for Shimei.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, in His lachrymary urn reserved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To long remembrance, treasures up such tears!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By him in turn, that Shimei needs must trust.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He thought of how the Lord, that extreme night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which He was betrayed, He knowing well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Father had given all things into His hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And He was come from God and went to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose from the supper, disarrayed Himself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if so laying His majesty aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clothe Himself in mightier majesty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meekness, with the servant's towel girded!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, pouring water in the basin, kneeled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girded in fashion as a menial, kneeled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord Himself of life and glory kneeled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washing and wiping his disciples' feet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Judas, Paul remembered, was among them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is my time," said he, "my time at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei will not resist nor say me nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, with mine own hands, will wash his feet."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Stephen said: "Lo, I have hated him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More wickedly than any, I beseech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine uncle let me do this thing to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shimei will know I do it for thy sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it will be to him as if thou didst it."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, Paul allowing it for his nephew's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad to confirm him in that gentleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen a ewer of water made haste to bring,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And there amid them all admiring him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Known to have hated Shimei so, he stooped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a most beautiful behavior stooped&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not without qualms of lothness overcome,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So softly did an inner current draw<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thanks to them all that ministered to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More: after days of silence, passed in muse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Seeking to hide his face as if in shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not shame that he had sinned, but that he now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had spoken thus. Yet did that gesture naught<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That Shimei, softened as he was, and changed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So Paul forbore, rejoiced that Shimei spoke<br /></span>

<p>Felix and Drusilla on the one hand and Krishna on the
other disclose the contrasted feelings severally excited in
them by what they had just witnessed in the lot of Shimei.
Krishna seeks from his friend Sergius Paulus explanation of
the relations that subsisted between those ministering Christians
and the sufferer. He at length requests and obtains an
interview with Paul, and the two have a conversation, one
result of which is that Krishna asks to hear a full account of
the life and character of Jesus Christ. Paul proposes that
Mary Magdalené give this account, but Krishna courteously
declines to receive it from the lips of a woman. The ship
meantime puts in at The Fair Havens, whence, after a short
stay in that anchorage, it sets sail, against the advice of Paul.</p>

<p>A violent storm occurs and the vessel is wrecked. Krishna,
having carefully noted the part that Paul takes in the rescue
of the lives of all on board, and having noted besides the
miracles performed by Paul on the island of Malta where
they come safe to shore, brings himself to signify now his
willingness to hear from Mary Magdalené her story of Jesus
Christ. A company assemble, including, with the Christians,
Julius as well as Krishna, and Mary begins her narrative.
This after a time is interrupted by a peremptory
summons from Felix to Paul, to which Paul responds in
person.</p>

<span class="i0">To perish in the waters; reason none,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"A woman herself possessed, then dispossessed,<br /></span>

<p>Paul declines to undertake the healing of Simon at
Felix's request. But Simon had first refused to suffer Paul's
access to him, at the same time warning both Felix and Drusilla
of the evil likely to result to their little son from a touch to
him of Paul's hand which the sick sorcerer had just observed
through the lattice. Felix and Drusilla, freshly angered at
Paul, resolve together on his destruction. A second meeting
assembles to hear Mary's story. This time there is an
interruption occasioned by a disturbing written message from
Felix, sent to Julius the centurion, one of the listeners.</p>

<span class="i0">I think that I can serve thy cause at Rome,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sudden as lightning and as branding bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke that word off, and Felix faltered on<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"A good round price they ask, whatever the kind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Felix was startled, but he cheerily said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Go to, I was just bargaining with Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have him use his laying on of hands<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We shall soon have thee out of this." But he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Paul shall not touch me, shall not look at me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear him, and I hate him; out upon him!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Listen to reason, Simon," Felix said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou canst not doubt he really works strange cures;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was the father of Sir Publius,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scores of sick among this native rabble<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I will have none of Paul; I will get well<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Simon moved in act as if to rise;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But Felix stayed him still his bed to keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thwarted, he returned to Paul, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He will not let thee lay thy hands on him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fit of foolish stubbornness, he fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, or pretends he fears; he certain hates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, no pretence. Well, he is right perhaps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You fellow-Jews ought to know one another.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against it to maintain his tone assumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of falsely-festive brutal cynicism.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helplessly dumb he hearkened, while Paul replied:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He recognized an echo in Paul's words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what he heard that day from those same lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then thought dreadful. 'Strange,' he dully mused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How moments of weakness sometimes find out men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should I then have feared, and naught to fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He sternly spake of judgment and hell-fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was as if the mount whereon He sat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And persecute you still, that ye may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children of your Father in the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For He His sun maketh to rise alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the evil and upon the good,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The oppressive publicans likewise? But ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then when, closing, with authority<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said: 'Whoever heareth these sayings of Mine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As never yet I knew them&mdash;never until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met and kissed each other at Calvary.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That," Mary with a look toward Krishna said,<br /></span>

<p>Drusilla has a confidential conference with Simon the
sorcerer, now recovered, though still weak. He tempts her
to think of ensnaring the emperor with her charms. He
insinuates into her mind the idea of making away with Felix
on the ground of his being an obstacle in her path to success
With this in view, he forms suddenly a plot to convict Felix
in his wife's eyes of infidelity to herself. He easily awakens
Drusilla's jealousy, and she, with her own motives, enters into
Simon's present proposals. Eunicé is accordingly invited to
visit Drusilla as one repentant and desirous of being a
Christian&mdash;Felix having meantime been filled by Simon
with the notion that Eunicé is enamored of him, Felix. She
comes with her mother to Felix's house, and the two are
there entrapped; but at the crisis of danger they are rescued
by young Stephen.</p>

<span class="i0">Yet hie ye to the uttermost remove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Felix," to the women spoken, he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning walked back with Julius who his pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now slacked to listen while the stripling told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What had befallen and how he feared for Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imperilled in that violent house alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Come in good time, however hither called,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felix to Julius said, with such a tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As seemed to ask how he was thither called.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy servant Syrus begged that I would come,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Julius, "for the safety of thy house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endangered by two women and a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had found entrance and were threatening thee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truth, that sly young slave of Felix's&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For reason ill-affected toward his lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much enamored of the Christian folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their fair manners, and the comely looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some of them, and the beneficent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working of wonders seen or heard from Paul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had summoned Julius in the true behoof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ruth with her Eunicé and of Stephen;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This, shrewdly under guise of service shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His master. Julius understood the guile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humored it, while Felix's thick wits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread ample cover to render Syrus safe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of course," so Julius added, "it had not seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needful to come, but that I also heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prisoner of my charge would here be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whose safe keeping I am answerable."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then glancing in a kindly neutral way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Stephen, he, with show of grave rebuke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could not wholly hide his lively sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whimsical humor in the part he played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mediator in such case, went on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This Hebrew youth confesses that, in haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spirit, he offered thee some disrespect."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With language purposely made light and vague<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus the centurion glozed Stephen's offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discreetly shunning to let Felix know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <em>he</em> knew from the offender's own report<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, for good cause, as to a happy end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The indignant youth inflicted on him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shame and anguish of that timely blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What wilt thou, my lord Felix," Julius asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou forgive the lad outright? Or pleasest<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou rather <em>I</em> condignly deal with him?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was astutely so proposed, to save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appearances <em>to</em> Felix and <em>for</em> him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gross-witted as he was, he yet was proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such end of the incident appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once some homage to his dignity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an escape unhoped from threatened shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He condescended loftily to leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The case of Stephen in the centurion's hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the centurion presently retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Paul and Stephen both. Stephen he bade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See to it that he never thenceforth act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less worthily of himself than he that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had done, and with no other reprimand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismissed him to rejoin his company.<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XVI.</h2>

<h3>INTERLUDE OF KRISHNA.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>


<p>Publius, the governor of the island, who in gratitude to
Paul for the healing of his father has opened his house to
the Christians for their meetings, now expresses, through
Sergius Paulus, his guest, a wish to hear himself the story
that Mary Magdalené is relating. The company accordingly
assemble in his house, and Publius is in courtesy asked to act
as a kind of master of the feast. He accepts the part, and
discharges it with much urbane demonstrativeness. Interrupting
Mary at one point of her story with exclamations of surprise
and pleasure, he proposes to Krishna that he offset what
has just been told with something parallel from the life of his
master Buddha. Krishna reluctantly complies, when, after
some comment following from Paul, Mary resumes her narrative.</p>

<p class="center">INTERLUDE OF KRISHNA.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For many following days in Melita<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no season of hospitality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To man from Nature under open sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Genial for ease and comfort out of doors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fair spacious halls of Publius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood smiling ever ready to entertain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resort of Paul or any dear to Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether for social worship in prayer and psalm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hearing of Paul discourse of things divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or for communion sweet of friend and friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here presently were gathered yet again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The company that had with one accord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already twice assembled to give ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Mary Magdalené while she told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her story still unfinished of the Lord.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Publius, as Roman to his Roman peer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Roman peer so versed in all the arts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the accomplishments urbane that make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amenity in companionship&mdash;had said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sergius Paulus (likewise, for his sake,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To Krishna), "Pray thee, honor thou my house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be content, abide with me a guest."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Sergius had to Publius rehearsed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The things that Mary those two afternoons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recounted, and the Roman lord would fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear from her lips the rest. So he was there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guest in a sort, while host, at his own hearth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sergius Paulus said:<br /></span>
<span class="i25">"O Publius, thou&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most welcome, as thou makest us welcome here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt, so it please thee, us all it will please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be the feast-master in the present feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of story and of audience. Krishna here"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courteous toward the Indian Sergius bowed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Has also a story to tell us of his lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether with alternation and relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between our two historians, or in course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one have finished, be the order best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judge thou for all, and all will grateful be."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let Mary Magdalené then go on,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Publius, "if she will, from where she ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the last audience;" and he turned to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With, "Sergius has most kindly made me know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far thy story, madam, with the rest<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of this good company. But, with thy peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the peace of Krishna and of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will upon occasion interrupt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For haply the occasion may arise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ask what contrast or what parallel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this or that of Jesus, Buddha yields."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So Mary, with some heightened flush like shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak in this new place and presence, yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sedately like herself and with a charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already round her ambient from the pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perfect, the accomplished womanhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hers was, purged of self, charm by all felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once ere her beginning, thus began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I think that I was saying, as my words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stayed at our last gathering on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How little like a tragedy so nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It looked to us, when we beheld the throngs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewing Christ's way before him with their robes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung down, and with green branches of the palm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouting their hosannas to His name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Jesus was not blinded as were we!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, on the brink of the descent arrived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steep from the Mount of Olives leading down,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the holy city with its sheen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of splendor from the temple roofs and walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, far removed from glorying at the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As king might welcomed to his capital,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept over it, with much-amazing tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried: 'Hadst thou but known, but known, even thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, even in this thy day but known the things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to thy peace belong! But they are hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from thine eyes. For days will come on thee&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then such dreadful days he told us of&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Days which our holy apostles think are nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence their 'Maranatha!' so often heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reminder watchword of the Lord at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They solemnly adjuring by the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved for our Jerusalem, a wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come upon her to the uttermost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when He, with the angels of His power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the lightning shineth suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ablaze from one end to the other of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall back return in clouds to execute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His judgment on the city that slew Him!"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"But wherefore," the centurion asked once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mary with a loyal look toward him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of honor for his kindly courtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day and ever bountiful to them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look too betokening welcome of his return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share the audience of her tale again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late interrupted by that message brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeming to be of sinister import&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary, with such a meaning so conveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paused, while the friendly Roman plied his quest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But wherefore did Jerusalem desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay one innocent of crime like him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some reason of state I dared to guess there was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what the reason of state, thou didst not tell,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning to Paul he said, and Paul replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Jewish rulers of the people said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'This Jesus, if we let him thus alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will draw all men to follow after him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Romans then will come and take away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike this city which belongs to us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and the nation over which we rule.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rescued remnant of authority<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wielded by the chief priests and Pharisees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over our nation under Roman sway,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This still was dear to them and this they feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To forfeit if the fame of Jesus grew."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And grow it did surpassing even their fears,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary resumed, at silent sign from Paul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For but a little while before, and nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, a height of miracle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus had wrought. One four days dead, nay, one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already four days in his sepulcher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Lord, with only 'Lazarus, come forth!'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commanded in loud voice before the tomb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned to life again. The dead came forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound hand and foot with grave-clothes, and his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound with a napkin round about&mdash;no pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not of an instant, in obeying that word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevention none felt from impediment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abrupt descent then from such miracle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the plain level of sobering commonplace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he whom Jesus from the dead could call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave his tomb, to stand upright, to walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unconscious of obstruction, swathed about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grave-clothes though he was, must be released<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By others from his bonds; the Master said<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To those near by, 'Loose him and let him go.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While Mary told these things, a sense diffused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of something felt by all the Christians there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt, but acknowledged not in word or sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signalled itself despite to all the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through a kind of dumb intelligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came that Publius, Julius, and that deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discerning Indian, Krishna, with one mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all, unspoken, fixed inquiring gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Rachel and on Stephen, who their hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime had silently, unconsciously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With simultaneous mutual movement clasped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if in token of some memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which they that moment felt between them rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some sacred memory, some undying love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Mary, with the happy instinct hers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what was fitting to be said, and when,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what more fitting to be left unsaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to say all, or how silent be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assuming, with a look of deference<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First toward the twain, their present leave to speak&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Granted to her as so much trusted in<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For wisdom, and for love in wisdom poised&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, with a certain courtesy implied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Publius as the master of the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the others needing to be told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That Lazarus, raised by Jesus from the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to the Christians of this company<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A name the dearer that to two of us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is the dearest memory of their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For after he had risen from the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Jesus' call he lived his human life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he before had done, till in due time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A husband and a father he became.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Rachel lives in honored widowhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, with her, half in orphanhood lives Stephen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he after fell asleep in Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be waked only when Christ comes again."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A tender pause succeeded, which all filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn, some with wondering, thought; and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempered, beyond his will or consciousness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a contagious mood of sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Publius most gently as feast-master spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The height of miracle well calledst thou<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Such summoning of the dead to life again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For greater wonder were not possible.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see it, as thou sawest it, was a gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed from the supernal powers; next is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have it in report of one who saw it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, for attestation of thy word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where attestation surely need was none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet serving for attestation, to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here those who knew the dead man raised to life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As husband and as father&mdash;all makes seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The story like reality itself.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And now," to Krishna turning, Publius said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Krishna, pray from thee a parallel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What comparable wonder wilt thou show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou hast seen thy master Buddha work?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The countenance fell to Krishna hearing this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quickly himself recovering he replied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am not able out of all I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning Buddha aught this day to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one that saw and heard; I never saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never heard, lord Buddha act or speak."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then from report that some eye-witness gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, speak and tell us what thou wilt, and we<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Will be therewith content"&mdash;so Publius, dashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little from his lively hope, but fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease the discomposure of his guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Krishna, in no wise more cheerful, said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor from eye-witness have I aught received<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my lord Buddha either said or did:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lived and passed five hundred years ago."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"But doubtless some memorials," Publius said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Were written by eye-witnesses of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he still lived, or close upon his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep so dear a memory alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And certify it to all aftertime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, out of such memorials known to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh still, though old five hundred years, because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then written when the images were fresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imprinted on the writer's mind of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He either saw or heard himself from Buddha&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange virtue has eye-witness testimony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In simultaneous records of the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay, though old, perennially young&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say, then, out of such memorials stored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treasured up in mind to thee speak thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it shall be to us as if thou hadst seen."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Publius, with all sincerity of aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hearten Krishna and make most the worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that which he, although eye-witness not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet reporter from eye-witness known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should proffer to that hospitality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of audience touching his dear master Buddh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had unawares confused him more and more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first time the Indian felt give way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little, melting underneath his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His standing-ground of settled certitude:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Was it all quicksand? Nothing there of rock?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he made answer: "O my courteous host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is uncertain, for tradition all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Indeed, we Indians care not for these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But trust full easily, or, not trusting, yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest as if trusting, in much unconcern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether that which we learn be wholly true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or partly not; and yet I have heard it said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, close upon the passing of the Buddh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A council of five hundred faithful met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who said together in accord complete&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sentence varying, nay, no syllable&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty mass of all the Exalted One's<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Instructions; but no writing then was made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor again afterward an hundred years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When such rehearsal came a second time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, truth to say, where all is doubt&mdash;for me,<br /></span>

<p>When the company next assemble, Publius greets them
with a feast spread in his house. This gives occasion for his
explaining the customs of his nation in the matter of recognizing
various divinities at feasts. Paul replies, setting forth
the Christian doctrine on this point. Mary, in due time about
to begin her narrative, is seized with a sudden faintness, which
however soon yielding to restoratives supplied by Ruth, she
goes on and relates the incidents of the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>

<p>The company still together though the hour is late,
Krishna, at the request of Publius, after a breathing-spell
enjoyed by all under the open sky, tells the story of the
death of Buddha. A warning recited by him as having proceeded
from the dying Buddha's lips against all speech on
the part of his disciples with womankind, prompts Krishna
to turn, with apology in his manner, in a kind of appeal to
Paul, who, answering, gives the contrasted teaching of Christianity
on this topic. At the conclusion of Krishna's recital,
Publius makes a few characteristic observations suggested by
it, and the company, having first agreed to assemble on some
favorable day at dawn to hear from Mary the story of the
resurrection of Jesus, disperse.</p>

<p>Krishna, much wrought upon in his secret mind, seeks a
private interview with Paul. The two converse at large, Paul
expounding his doctrine of sin and of salvation through faith in
Christ. Krishna resists, feeling nevertheless an impulse in
himself responsive to Paul's words. They part with nothing
concluded between them, but Krishna meditating alone is
finally brought to obedience of faith. He seeks the company
of the Christian disciples and declares himself a believer.
He expressing eager desire to testify as soon as possible in
some outward act commanded by Jesus his readiness to obey
Him, Paul tells him of the command "Be baptized," and
Krishna accordingly is baptized by Aristarchus, Paul giving
the new disciple appropriate counsel and exhortation.</p>

<p>Ruth and Mary Magdalené waking very early talk with
one another having not yet risen, and Mary discloses a placid
premonition that she has of her own imminent death. They
thus engaged, a signal sound from without is heard in notes
from Stephen on his pipe. The summons is for the meeting
proposed to hear Mary's story of the resurrection.</p>

<p>The company repair to a hilltop of easy access and goodly
prospect, where after a matin prayer from Paul Mary tells
her story. She has scarcely ended, when she gently sinks in
death. Paul on occasion of this speaks comfortingly, not
without tears of personal sorrow for Mary's loss, of the resurrection
awaiting the dead in Christ.</p>

<p>Meantime Simon the sorcerer having observed from a
distance the meeting of the Christians puts his own sinister
interpretation on what occurred, which, so interpreted, he reports,
to Paul's disadvantage, to Felix and Drusilla, with suggestion
of use that may be made of it in evidence against the
apostle at Rome.</p>

<p>At sunset of the same day the Christians gather to the
burial of Mary on the spot where she died, and Paul describes
the promised return of Jesus to accomplish the triumphant
rapture and resurrection of the saints.</p>

BOOK XXI.</h2>

<h3>ARRIVAL.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>


<p>The day following, the shipwrecked company embark on
a vessel that had wintered at Melita and sail for Puteoli.
The islanders give Paul and his companions a grateful farewell
of good wishes and of presents for their cheer. With
Felix and Drusilla goes as a fresh addition to their train a
Phrygian runaway slave whom Syrus, a young slave of Felix's,
has befriended and has devised thus to get safely to Rome.
Stephen is made confidant of this plan, and becoming interested
in the runaway introduces him to Paul. The foot journey
from Puteoli to Rome is accomplished, the approach to
that city being made along the Appian Way. Various reflections
are inspired in Paul by this experience and by the sight
of the metropolis itself. At Rome, the Phrygian runaway
slave goes to Paul's quarters, merged in the daily concourse
that throngs thither to hear the gospel. Having been converted,
he is encouraged by Paul to return to his master.
This he finally does, carrying with him a letter from Paul.
The result is, that the slave at the wish of the master comes
joyfully back to Rome and devotes himself to the loving service
of Paul.</p>

<span class="i0">He should be safely lost in multitude<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Meeting the fugitive had befriended him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onesimus&mdash;such name the bondman bore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wisely warned that, wandering unattached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And destitute (for spent long since was all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had in starting from his lord purloined),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He advertised himself for what he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vagrant slave, and ran a needless risk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Attach thyself," said Syrus, "to the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my lord Felix; I will manage it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall receive thee; he delights in pomp<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Onesimus, so doing as Syrus planned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His part, was reckoned of lord Felix slave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In his own house in Melita such harm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, Stephen in time had come to know; nor ceased<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His grateful wish Stephen had signified<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus Stephen with Onesimus had talked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not often, for need was that all should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transacted as in secret to avoid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felix's, more, Drusilla's, jealous watch&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not often but so many times as served<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To yield some true impression to the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what the slave was in his manhood's worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to inflame a generous desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rescue for him to a nobler life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stephen spoke of Onesimus to Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paul on shipboard came to speech with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The runaway's heart was wholly won to Paul;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Onesimus had gladly promised Stephen<br /></span>

<h3>DRUSILLA AND NERO.</h3>

<p>While Paul in chains is writing to Christian churches
letters characterized at once by the sublimest reaches of
spiritual vision and by the most painstaking condescension
to details of practical precept, Simon the sorcerer, with Felix
and Drusilla, plots the apostle's death. Simon proceeds by
indirection, having it in mind to bring about the death of
Felix also. This he accomplishes, with the collusion and
complicity of Drusilla. But first, at Drusilla's instance, he
procures for her in company with her husband an audience
with Nero, of which Poppæa, the emperor's favorite, is secretly
an observer. Poppæa notices the impression made on her
sovereign by Drusilla, and she is openly present at a subsequent
hearing granted by Nero to the beautiful Jewess, during
which the latter accuses Paul, together with other crimes,
of instigating the murder by poison of Felix. Nero throughout
displays, with much license, his reckless and frivolous
character.</p>

<span class="i0">Syrus could not refrain himself from saying<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Yea, noble lady, none can ever lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aught by obeying Christ the Lord in heaven."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What meanest thou, boy?" Drusilla sharply said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lord other than lord Felix hast thou then?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wrought in him, and, supported as it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With instinct of unquenchable revolt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Felix and Drusilla both alike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buoyed him and kept him firm in that assay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yea, madam," he replied, "I have a lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ Jesus, crucified once, but alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now and ascended far above all height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the right hand of God in heaven set down."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That is of Paul, that surely is of Paul!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drusilla reasoned; then, with threatening brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Syrus: "Whence these things to thee? The truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast heard Paul, and learned such lies from him?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I have heard Paul, yea, madam, and have learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him such truth as makes me true to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond what ever I had been before."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Aye, aye, no doubt," Drusilla, musing, sneered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light broke in upon her mind; she said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That precious runaway, Onesimus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, I suppose, heard Paul, and got himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puffed up with these same notions of a lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, which set him feeling free of us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, what knowest thou of Onesimus?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Shrewd as he was, Syrus conceived a hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden simple hope that if the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beautiful mere truth, were told her now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drusilla, yea, Drusilla even, would feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its power. So he rehearsed the history,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that Onesimus, induced by Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gone back to his master at Colossæ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that his master, for the love of Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had erst won him to the love of Jesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bidden Onesimus return to Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in his stead to minister to Paul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How that Onesimus had gladly come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was that moment gratefully with Paul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drusilla listened, but she gave no sign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had in truth been listening absently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absorbedly considering what fresh proof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purpose against Paul perhaps was here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said to Syrus: "Aye, a pretty tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To entertain thy mistress' ear withal!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why never can you people tell the truth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You always seem to think you must contrive<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Be ready, when thy master to his bath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall presently repair, bring me prompt word.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Syrus, deep scrupling, 'Fair is this, or foul?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet found no way not to fulfill the word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felix said: "This is strange. What sayest thou, boy?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I know I should offend by drinking it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou mightst take it somewhat heedfully,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trying it drop by drop at first to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its virtue and its fitness to thy case."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Syrus pleaded; and his master said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That is not spoken like a poisoner.<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK XXIII.</h2>

<h3>NERO AND SIMON.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span></p>


<p>Simon, sent by Drusilla to the emperor, finds it impossible
to reach the imperial presence without help from Poppæa,
who grants him her favor only on condition that he will serve
her wish at need. The crafty sorcerer buys his way with the
necessary promises. Nero flouts Simon with disdainful irony
and sarcasm, which excites the sorcerer's resentment. This
feeling he dissembles, while he counsels the unfaithful imperial
husband how to rid himself of his young empress Octavia&mdash;the
sorcerer being all the time in doubt whether it is with
Drusilla or with Poppæa that the emperor, who speaks darkly,
would supplant her.</p>

<p>Nero at length dismisses Simon, bidding him tell his mistress
the emperor's desire to pay her a secret visit. This
message the sorcerer gratifies his own spleen by conveying to
Drusilla in terms the most offensive to her pride. She bursts
out in violent anger and spurning; but Simon shows his mistress
how she may salve in a measure the hurt to her dignity,
and at the same time serve her hatred of Paul, by making it
a condition of her complaisance that the emperor shall first
put the apostle and his companions to death. The sorcerer
returns with her reply to Nero, who again, and even more
deeply than before, stirs the Jew's heart to deadly hatred.
Simon plots a wild scheme to have his revenge. Meantime
with change in certain officers of the government the aspect
of affairs grows threatening for Paul and his fellow-Christians.
Onesimus and Syrus are arrested and hurried away to suffer
on the rack.</p>

<span class="i0">"Lady Drusilla's interests and her aims<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who worthily possessest now the power."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not all the power," Poppæa sagely said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Some real part of the power is in the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to win the name, and fix thy price."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But to gain time, and to secure access,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His present errand, to the emperor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He added, with demure and downcast look:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The ground beneath us now is treacherous;<br /></span>

<h3>THE END.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span></p>


<p>The two slaves, Onesimus and Syrus, bear their torture
with constancy, refusing to testify otherwise than in grateful
praise of Paul. The emperor, at Seneca's prompting, has
secretly overheard their testimony, and, obeying a caprice of
justice and of pity, he follows a further hint from Seneca to
let Paul go free under bond to appear again when formal
accusation shall be laid against him from Jerusalem. Paul
thus released sends home to Holy Land the friends that had
thence accompanied him to Rome, and accomplishes his last
missionary tours, with Luke only for companion.</p>

<p>Meantime Drusilla, in a desperate hope revived by the
rumored fall from imperial favor of Poppæa, sends Simon
once more to secure for his mistress the long-postponed meeting
with Nero. Simon plays Drusilla false and pretends to
the emperor that she had indulgently sent him, Simon, to
sue on his own behalf for the privilege of practising his art in
the palace. Nero agrees that he may do this on condition
that he shall first have secured from his mistress fresh consent
to receive an imperial visit in her house. Simon, stung
by the emperor's scorn of him, had wrought himself up to
the temerity of attempting to play on Nero's guilty conscience
by an exhibition that should bring up before the
tyrant a dreadful recollection of one of his own most heinous
crimes. The result proves suddenly fatal to Simon.</p>

<p>Paul, brought back in due time for trial, becomes the
victim not only of enmity openly working under legal forms
against him, but of secret intrigue for unholy personal purposes
on the emperor's part. Condemned to die, after having
been permitted first to speak in his own defence, the apostle
is led to a suburb of Rome, and there beheaded. Luke, enjoined
thereto by Paul, gives to his kindred and friends in
Palestine an account of the end, of which he was eye-witness.</p>

<span class="i0">This was while they were binding the poor slaves<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of something that resembled justice too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward Paul so stoutly witnessed for by them.<br /></span>

<p class="center s08">A COMPANION TO "THE EPIC OF PAUL"</p>


<p class="noind">SAUL OF TARSUS, brought up at Jerusalem, a pupil of
Gamaliel, the most celebrated Rabbi of his time, from
setting out as eager but pacific controversialist in public dispute
against the preachers of the Gospel, changes into a virulent,
bloody persecutor of Christians, and ends by abruptly becoming
himself a Christian and a teacher of Christianity. <span class="smcap">The
Epic of Saul</span> tells the story of this. "It is the great success
of the poem," says Prof. John A. Paine, "to put the reader in
the place of those who opposed the rising and rapidly spreading
faith in Jesus, and to unfold a marvellous insight into the
reasonings, motives, intrigues, and action of those actually
engaged in trying to suppress the new movement; and thus,
it helps to form a remarkably vivid conception of the crisis,
and to gain a deeper understanding of the conflict."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Saul in the Council Stephen's face saw shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it had been an angel's, but his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the august theophany was blind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinded by hatred of the fervent saint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hatred of the Lord who in him shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What blindfold hatred such could work of ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In nature meant for utter nobleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how the hatred could to love be turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proud wrong will to lowly right be brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paul the 'servant' spring from rebel Saul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, ye who love in man the good and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy to hail retrieved the good and fair&mdash;<br /></span>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
